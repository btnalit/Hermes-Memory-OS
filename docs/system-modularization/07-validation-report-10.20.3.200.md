# Memory-OS v0.1 Module Validation Report For 10.20.3.200

Date: 2026-05-21

## Target

- Host alias: `hermes-media`
- Host IP: `10.20.3.200`
- Hostname: `debian`
- User: `root`
- Hermes home: `/root/.hermes`
- Deployment repository: `/tmp/hermes-memory-os-validation/repo`
- Deployment commit: `ac7873d Package agent compatibility runtime`

This validation targets the `10.20.3.200` staging Hermes host only. It does not
touch `10.20.2.88`.

## Deployment Summary

Memory-OS v0.1 modules were deployed to the existing main staging profile.

Installed surfaces:

- provider plugin: `/root/.hermes/plugins/memory_os`
- runtime heartbeat artifacts: `/root/.hermes/memory-os/bin` and
  `/root/.hermes/memory-os/systemd`
- portable module runtime package:
  `/root/.hermes/memory-os/runtime/python/plugins`
- agent compatibility package:
  `/root/.hermes/memory-os/runtime/python/agent`
- profile-local module registry and state:
  `/root/.hermes/system-modules`

The install command did not request provider enablement because the staging
host already had `memory.provider=memory_os`.

```bash
HERMES_HOME=/root/.hermes \
python3 scripts/install_memory_os_plugin.py \
  --hermes-home /root/.hermes \
  --install-runtime \
  --install-system-modules
```

Installer result:

```text
provider files copied: 22
system module runtime files copied: 45
agent runtime files copied: 2
runtime artifacts installed: true
runtime enabled by this command: false
provider enabled by this command: false
```

## Pre-Install Discovery

Before the v0.1 module deployment, the host already reported Memory-OS as the
active Hermes memory provider:

```text
Provider: memory_os
Plugin: installed
Status: available
Active plugin: memory_os (local)
```

Existing plugin location:

```text
/root/.hermes/plugins/memory_os
```

Existing canonical store:

```text
/root/.hermes/memory-os
```

## Host Test Evidence

Remote repository was reset to the deployment commit:

```text
49a5f66 Install portable system modules runtime
66d1d66 Harden module review evidence
65283d6 Add would-send speak gate module
```

After fixing the missing runtime `agent` compatibility package, final deployment
used:

```text
ac7873d Package agent compatibility runtime
```

Remote test subset:

```text
python3 -m pytest tests/scripts/test_memory_os_plugin_install.py tests/system_modularization -q
76 passed in 0.46s
```

The same test subset had passed locally before deployment:

```text
76 passed in 3.71s
```

Local full suite before deployment:

```text
python -m pytest -q
176 passed in 12.04s
python -m compileall -q agent plugins scripts
passed
git diff --check
passed
```

## Runtime Import Finding And Fix

The first host import attempt showed a real packaging gap:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agent'
```

Cause:

- `--install-system-modules` copied `plugins/`
- module imports eventually loaded `plugins.memory.memory_os.__init__`
- that provider package imports `agent.memory_provider`
- the runtime package did not include `agent/`

Fix:

- installer now copies `agent/__init__.py` and `agent/memory_provider.py` to
  `$HERMES_HOME/memory-os/runtime/python/agent`
- regression coverage added to `tests/scripts/test_memory_os_plugin_install.py`

Fixed in commit:

```text
ac7873d Package agent compatibility runtime
```

## Module Lifecycle Validation

The host validation script imported modules from:

```text
PYTHONPATH=/root/.hermes/memory-os/runtime/python
```

Detected event profile:

```json
{"default": 11}
```

The following modules were installed through `ModuleLifecycle` and enabled for
profile `default`:

```text
mailbox: no-send
household_digest: no-send
wandering_mind: no-send
inner_drive: no-send
ops_gate: no-send
proposal_queue: no-send
evidence_scoring: no-send
self_evolution: no-send
speak_gate: would-send
```

This only writes profile-local module state. It does not start schedules and
does not enable real send.

## Integrated No-Send Flow

Host-level module validation ran the following path:

```text
Memory-OS events
-> household_digest
-> wandering_mind
-> speak_gate.evaluate_wandering_output()
-> inner_drive
-> ops_gate
-> proposal_queue
-> speak_gate proposal check before owner review
-> proposal_queue owner approve for proposal-only
-> speak_gate proposal check after owner review
-> evidence_scoring
-> self_evolution dry-run proposal
```

Key result:

```json
{
  "profile": "default",
  "household_digest": {"event_count": 11},
  "wandering_mind": {"would_send": true, "actual_send": false},
  "wandering_delivery": {"decision": "would_send", "actual_send": false},
  "inner_drive": {"processed_event_count": 1, "actual_send": false},
  "ops_gate": {"status": "warning", "decision_count": 1, "actual_execute": false},
  "proposal_before_approval": {"decision": "no_send", "actual_send": false},
  "proposal_after_approval": {"decision": "would_send", "actual_send": false},
  "evidence_scoring": {"score_count": 36, "actual_approve": false},
  "self_evolution": {
    "status": "ok",
    "proposal_created": true,
    "direct_self_modify": false,
    "actual_execute": false
  }
}
```

Validated invariants:

```json
{
  "no_actual_send": true,
  "ops_gate_no_execute": true,
  "self_evolution_no_execute": true,
  "proposal_approval_not_crystallized": true
}
```

## Memory-OS Doctor

After module validation, `memory_os doctor` initially reported an index count
mismatch because the module run wrote working/candidate/audit artifacts after
the previous index pass.

Recovery action:

```bash
HERMES_HOME=/root/.hermes hermes memory_os heartbeat --max-events 100
```

Post-heartbeat doctor:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "memory-os.doctor.v0",
  "status": "ok",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "findings": [
    {
      "code": "hindsight_adapter_disabled",
      "severity": "warning"
    }
  ]
}
```

The Hindsight warning is expected because Hindsight is disabled as an optional
adapter and is not canonical storage.

Post-validation status:

```text
events: 11
working_items: 12
crystallized_candidates: 12
crystallized_records: 0
queue_backlog: 0
prefetch_mode: indexed
index_health: healthy after heartbeat recovery
```

## Gateway Restart

The running gateway needed a single restart to load the refreshed provider code.
Only the `10.20.3.200` main staging gateway was restarted.

```text
before: ActiveState=active, SubState=running, MainPID=427105
after:  ActiveState=active, SubState=running, MainPID=428485
```

Post-restart memory discovery:

```text
Provider: memory_os
Plugin: installed
Status: available
Active plugin: memory_os (local)
```

Post-restart doctor:

```text
status: ok
only finding: hindsight_adapter_disabled warning
```

## Safety Boundaries

Confirmed:

- no command touched `10.20.2.88`
- no real Telegram/mailbox send occurred
- no Hindsight export occurred
- no crystallized record was approved or written
- no identity source was modified
- no production gateway was restarted
- only `10.20.3.200` staging `hermes-gateway.service` was restarted

## Residual Observation Items

1. ModuleBus v0.1 remains append/read JSONL; no blocking subscribe API yet.
2. Runtime supervisor for automatic schema re-check and owner alert is still out
   of scope.
3. The staging host now has module state under `/root/.hermes/system-modules`;
   future deployments should treat that as profile-local evidence, not code.
4. Longer 24-48h observation is still needed for lock contention, audit growth,
   and timer stability.

## Verdict

PASS for `10.20.3.200` full plugin deployment and no-send module validation.

The next step is observation on the staging host, not production migration.
